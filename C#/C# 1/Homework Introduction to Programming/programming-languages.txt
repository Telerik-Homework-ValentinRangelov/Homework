Top 5 Programming languages currently used in projects (Jan 2014)
           
                                                        
1.Java-  Java is a functional computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[11] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another                    
2.C# - C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma and ISO. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.         
3.PHP - PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.While PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, it now stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, which is a recursive backronym.     
4.C++ - C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.                                       
5.Javascript - Javascript  is a dynamic computer programming language.It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
